        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

    <string name="show_text">请不要在你拿工资的地方玩手机

　　当一个顾客，进店时看到店里的员工低头玩手机，会有什么感觉？

　　当你老婆总抱怨嫁给你没有过好日子的时候？

　　当你抱怨自己买不起房子的时候？

　　当你抱怨别人对你不够好的时候……

　　请先想想你又是什么样子……

　　想想自己这一天都做了什么？

　　是否真的尽力了？

　　其实是糊弄自己……

　　天道酬勤，人道酬诚，商道酬信，业道酬精！

　　放下手机，好好工作，从我做起！

　　一个力求上进的人，很多做人做事的标准，不需要别人督促！

　　不要在领工资的地方玩手机！

　　换位思考

　　——假如设想你现在是老板，会愿意聘用现在的自己吗？

　　——如果非常乐意，那就继续这样做下去；

　　——如果相反你不愿意聘用自己，那就应该去反思你自己当下的行为！

　　——不怕聘用没有工作经验的人，但最终放弃的是没有工作态度的人，无论你是谁！

　　——毕竟，在工作中偷奸耍滑；做事情阴奉阳违；当面工作积极，背后消极怠工；看老板干活，视收入做事；事事斤斤计较于眼前利益得失，这些事情再会伪装的人，都是骗不过自己的！

　　——最后，连你自己都不愿意雇佣自己，你怎么去让你的老板重用你？

　　——能保住现在给你的薪水就不错了——

　　——如果你混日子，对不起，实际上你是混自己，

　　——如果你在公司混日子，你能黑老板多少钱？

　　——可是你，如果在公司几年不好好工作，荒废了几年，几年后你怎么办呢？

　　——你觉得你有竞争力吗？年轻时候吃苦不算什么，老了还要吃苦，才是最可悲的！

　　——致所有努力的人，自省！

　　恶性循坏

　　——当实体店生意不好时，大部分实体店看起来死气沉沉，每个人耷着脑袋、无精打采，店里不开灯，一眼看进去黑乎乎……顾客越发感觉这家餐厅没人气、不敢进，所以恶性循环。

　　当生意不好时——

　　我会让团队打扮的干干净净、帅气靓丽，然后组织大家一起在门口唱歌、跳舞，让路过的顾客感受我们的热情和阳光，更重要的，我想告诉团队：失去什么都不能失去信心！

　　当生意不好时——

　　我会做一个大大的、颜色干净明亮的、非常有吸引力的大海报，上面放上我们的主打产品，放在我们店门口，让路过的顾客一定多看一眼。看一眼，就多一个机会。

　　当生意不好时——

　　我会把店的灯开的亮亮的、足足的，带大家一起整理店面的产品展示台，让经过的顾客看到店里更多的产品：它们那么诱人！

　　当生意不好时——

　　我会在店里组织大家打扫卫生，连植物的叶子也擦一次，把台面桌椅擦干净，早上10点前，下午5点后做一次，时刻保持店面整洁，让每一个进店的客人随时感受品牌高档的环境。

　　当生意不好时——

　　我会走遍附近的门店，看看生意旺店是如何经营的，对比自家门店，找出不足，然后一点一滴的改。

　　当生意不好时——

　　顾客一个一个的抓，一单一单的维护。这个时候员工会产生懈怠心理，我会在班前、班后会上强调：打起十二分的精神，让顾客来一次，就要感觉到“没白来”，一个顾客一个顾客的抓，一单一单的维护住顾客。

　　当生意不好时——

　　我会发动我们身边的每一个人成为我们的宣传员，把我们产品发到网络、发到朋 友 圈，让朋友去影响朋友！生意不好，未必是我们的产品不好，很可能是我们的客户基数不够大，所以，我们要让更多的人知道我们。

　　当生意不好时——

　　门店越是没生意，服务就越不能落下。将员工分成PK小组，提高工作能力，增加干劲。

　　当生意不好时——

　　我会盘点周边门店比较受顾客欢迎的活动，寻找主题，贴合产品的具体情况推出营销活动。

　　这样坚持三个月以后，生意出现了奇迹般的好转……

　　所以，请相信一点一滴付出的力量！</string>
